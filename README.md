# My 3000 Pyrenees

**My 3000 Pyrenees** is a web-based application that allows users to track and visualize their ascents of 3,000-meter peaks in the Pyrenees mountain range. This tool is ideal for hikers, mountaineers, and adventurers looking to log and celebrate their achievements.

The app provides an interactive map, statistics on ascents, and the ability to customize your peak-climbing journey.

## About the Project
The Pyrenees mountain range boasts 11 peaks that rise above 3,000 meters. This project helps you track your progress as you summit these impressive mountains. The app visualizes completed and pending ascents on a dynamic map.

### Motivation
The project was developed out of a passion for climbing and exploring the Pyrenees. It serves as a personal ascent log but is open for anyone who wants to track their climbing milestones.

## Features
- **Interactive map** showing all 3,000-meter peaks in the Pyrenees.
- **Track completed ascents** and update your progress visually.
- **\* Log additional details** such as date, route, and difficulty for each peak.
- **\* View ascent statistics**, including a summary of remaining and completed peaks.
- **Accessible on any modern web browser** (mobile and desktop).

\* Comming soon...

## Screenshots
This is how the map looks. Already logged ascents will show in green, they can be logged both on the map or on the table, it gets automatically updated.

Main peaks are in bold and secondary ones in normal characters. Peaks that have been recently removed from the original list are still listed but dashed and with a red backround.
